# üêæ PRD: Hashlings ‚Äì A Monster-Raising Web Game

---

## üìå Overview

**Hashlings** is a web-based monster-raising game inspired by classics like _Monster Rancher_ and _Tamagotchi_. Users generate a unique monster based on their chosen username, which determines their creature's initial stats and appearance. Players can raise, evolve, and care for their monsters through simple time-based actions, with optional PvP and seasonal events for long-term engagement.

---

## üåü Goals

- Launch a lightweight, nostalgic monster-raising game with high replay value.
    
- Allow players to create unique monsters with no two alike.
    
- Encourage daily/weekly check-ins through idle-care mechanics.
    
- Create a game loop that supports sharing, casual competition, and personalization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- **Framework:** React.js or SvelteKit
    
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS or CSS Modules
    
- **State:** Zustand or React Context
    
- **UI Elements:** SVG-based monster sprites; dynamic stat display
    

### Backend

- **Auth & Storage:** Firebase or Supabase
    
- **Database:** Real-time DB for monster state & user sessions
    
- **Game Logic:** Serverless functions for stat updates, evolution checks
    
- **Seed Generator:** Hashing algorithm (SHA256 or CRC32) to convert usernames to deterministic seeds
    

### Database Schema

To ensure monsters persist across sessions, the following schema is proposed:

#### `users` Table

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|id|UUID|Unique user identifier|
|username|String|Login name (used to generate seed)|
|created_at|Timestamp|Date account was created|

#### `monsters` Table

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Field|Type|Description|
|id|UUID|Unique monster ID|
|user_id|UUID|Foreign key to `users` table|
|species|String|Monster species|
|element|String|Elemental affinity|
|size_category|String|Small / Medium / Large|
|base_size|Float|Numeric size after size modifier|
|stats|JSON|Object storing Strength, Agility, etc.|
|mood|Integer|Mood score (0‚Äì100)|
|energy|Integer|Current energy level|
|favorite_food|String|Preferred food item|
|stage|Integer|Evolution stage|
|created_at|Timestamp|Date the monster was generated|

#### `actions` Table

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Field|Type|Description|
|id|UUID|Unique action ID|
|monster_id|UUID|Foreign key to `monsters` table|
|action_type|String|e.g., "feed", "train", "rest"|
|result|JSON|Stat gains, mood effects, event trigger|
|timestamp|Timestamp|Time of the action|

This schema ensures persistent storage of player monsters, their growth, and daily interactions. Additional tables (e.g., for inventory or achievements) can be added later.

### Game Engine

- Lightweight rules engine (custom JS logic) for:
    
    - Stat influence
        
    - Time-based events
        
    - Evolution tree
        

### Frontend

- **State:** Zustand or React Context
    
- **UI Elements:** SVG-based monster sprites; dynamic stat display

- **Database:** Real-time DB for monster state & user sessions
    
- **Game Logic:** Serverless functions for stat updates, evolution checks
    
- **Seed Generator:** Hashing algorithm (SHA256 or CRC32) to convert usernames to deterministic seeds
    

### Game Engine

    - Stat influence
        
    - Time-based events
        
    - Evolution tree
        

### Username-to-Monster Generation Logic

When a user enters their login name, the system generates a deterministic monster with a specific species, elemental affinity, and size category using the following pipeline:

1. **Hashing**:
    
    - The username string is passed through a hash function (e.g., SHA256) to produce a large hexadecimal value.
        
2. **Seed Derivation**:
    
    - The hash is split into substrings to derive values for species, element, and size. For example:
        
        - First 4 hex digits ‚Üí `Species Index`
            
        - Next 4 hex digits ‚Üí `Element Index`
            
        - Next 4 hex digits ‚Üí `Size Modifier`
            
3. **Species Assignment**:
    
    - Convert the `Species Index` into a number and use modulo operation to map it to the species list.
        
4. **Element Assignment**:
    
    - Same approach with `Element Index` and the 8 defined elements.
        
5. **Size Category Assignment**:
    
    - The `Size Modifier` is mapped to one of three categories:
        
        - `0x0000`‚Äì`0x5555` ‚Üí Small
            
        - `0x5556`‚Äì`0xAAAA` ‚Üí Medium
            
        - `0xAAAB`‚Äì`0xFFFF` ‚Üí Large
            
6. **Stat Adjustment**:
    
    - Base stats from species table.
        
    - Adjusted by size category rules:
        
        - Small: -0.5 base size, +Agility, -Fortitude
            
        - Medium: No change
            
        - Large: +1.5 base size, +Fortitude, -Agility
            
7. **Final Output**:
    
    - A fully generated monster with:
        
        - Species
            
        - Element
            
        - Size Category
            
        - Modified Stats
            
        - Special Ability

## üîÆ Mood, Training & Feeding Systems

### Mood System

- Mood is a dynamic stat ranging from 0 to 100.
    
- Influences training success, obedience, and special evolution conditions.
    
- Mood Modifiers:
    
    - Feeding favorite food: +10
        
    - Feeding disliked food: -10
        
    - Training success: +5
        
    - Training failure: -5
        
    - Ignored for a day: -15
        
    - Resting: +5‚Äì15 (scales with element)
        

**Mood Effects**:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Mood Range|Description|Effect|
|80‚Äì100|Joyful|+10% to training success and obedience|
|50‚Äì79|Neutral|Normal behavior|
|20‚Äì49|Moody|-10% training success; may refuse commands|
|0‚Äì19|Rebellious or Depressed|Refuses care actions, evolution blocked|

---

### Training

- Each day, player may select **one stat to train**.
    
- Training has a chance to succeed based on:
    
    - Current mood
        
    - Elemental affinity
        
    - Monster's size (e.g., Large = harder to train Agility)
        
- Training Outcome:
    
    - Success ‚Üí +1 to +3 in targeted stat
        
    - Failure ‚Üí +0 or -1 Mood
        

**Sample Success Formula**:  
`Base Chance = 80%`  
`+ Elemental Bonus (if stat matches element)`  
`+ Mood Modifier (¬±10%)`  
`- Size Penalty (if applicable)`

---

### Feeding

- Each monster has preferred and disliked food types (e.g., meat, plants, sweets).
    
- Feeding affects mood and weight (future feature for evolutions/appearance).
    

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Food Type|Example Items|Effect on Mood|Notes|
|Favorite|Roast Beast, Berries|+10 Mood|Increases bond|
|Neutral|Standard Feed|+0 to +5 Mood||
|Disliked|Spoiled Meat, Candy|-10 Mood|Can trigger rebellion|

Feeding also restores **energy** and may occasionally trigger **dream events** or **elemental reactions** based on affinity.

---

## üßô Species

Each species has a defined **base size**, which can be modified based on the user's generated size category. This modifier affects stats and physical scale:

- **Small**: -0.5 from base size (minimum of 0.2); **+Agility**, **-Fortitude**
    
- **Medium**: Unchanged base size; balanced stats
    
- **Large**: +1.5 to base size; **+Fortitude**, **-Agility**
